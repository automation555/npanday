Prerequisites
* csc.exe must be available on your PATH.  Usually it can be found in
  C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\[version]
* NUnit must be installed or otherwise configured

Initial Build
* The latest version of NPanday requires .NET 2.0+ to build and run NPanday.
  This is due to needing the .NET 2.0 AppDomainManagers for executing Maven
  .NET plugins. You may still target your own projects with .NET 1.1 build.
* On the first build, for Windows execute
    bootstrap-build.bat [ -DMicrosoft | -DVisualStudio2005 | -DMono ]
  Or on *nix,
    bootstrap-build.sh

If this is a clean build (meaning that you do not have a
~/.m2/npanday-settings.xml file) then you will also need to make sure that you
have csc within your path. On subsequent builds, you can just type
  mvn -f pom.xml install
from the command prompt.

IntelliJ IDEA Setup
* Do the initial build. This will create the dotnet modello model source code
  and will download all of the maven binary dependencies. Next, click the
  maven-dotnet.ipr file. Go to settings/Path variables and set localRepository
  to your ~/.m2/repository directory (specify the absolute path). Exit
  IntelliJ and click the maven-dotnet.ipr file. Now all of the binary
  dependencies will be mapped to the local maven repo.

Deploying NPanday Artifacts (File System Only)
* On the command line
    set phase=deploy
    set deploy.directory=${remoteRepository}
    bootstrap-build.bat
* Due to a bug with not being able to use snapshots with an executables
  exe.config file, you will need to do this next step manually: Copy the
  NPanday.Plugin.Resx.exe.config file
  in NPanday\Plugins\NPanday.Plugin.Resx\1.1-SNAPSHOT from the local
  repository to the remote repository.

To set up a remote repository accessible to others, you can transfer the
contents of ${remoteRepository} from your file system to a web server.

Generating CS Project Files and Solutions:
 * Go to the directory containing a pom file.
 * type: mvn npanday.plugin:maven-solution-plugin:solution

If the project was multi-module, the plugin will pick those up as well.

Setting up the Visual Studio 2005 Addin:
 After building the project with bootstrap-build -DVisualStudio2005
 * To generate the Addin for VisualStudio type:
     mvn npanday.plugin:maven-vsinstaller-plugin:install
 * Start the IDE
 * Click on an NPanday project
 * Click on Tools/NPanday Addin

Building Against NonPublic Repo (For release versions)
 Deploy openrdf artifacts to internal repo
 Deploy Castle artifacts to internal repo
 Type: bootstrap-build.bat -DrdfProfile.none -DVisualStudio2005
