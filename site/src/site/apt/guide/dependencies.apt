Project Dependencies

  This section defines the basic configuration of adding references into the project. To avoid runtime errors,
  make sure that the library to be loaded does not have conflicting instance(s) and/or is not yet loaded in the .NET 
  Framework.
  
  <<Note>>: Adding dependencies should be done using Visual Studio while manually adding is not recommended. At this
  time, the Visual Studio add-in will not detect changes to the Maven dependencies and add them to your Visual Studio
  project. If you manually add a dependency and re-import the project in Visual Studio, the recently added dependencies
  are deleted from the <<<pom.xml>>> file.

  Dependency Types:

  * normal - Local repository content artifacts that are added as dependencies.

  * <<<gac_msil>>> - Artifacts that are installed in the GAC and used as references. Configuration similar to the following is used,
  <<< \<type\>gac_msil\</type\> >>>

  * <<<system>>> - Artifact references to standard framework namespaces. Configuration similar to the following is added,
  <<< \<scope\>system\</scope\> >>> and the <<< \<systemPath\>[path_to_library]\</systemPath\> >>>

  * <<<com_references>>> - Artifact references to Component Object Model that is installed in the system.
  Configuration similar to the following is used, <<< \<type\>com_reference\</type\> >>>

~~TODO discuss adding normal references, including inter-project dependencies

* Adding System Scope Dependencies

  To add a system scope dependency, add a configuration similar to the following in the project's pom.xml:
  
+------+
<dependencies>
  [...]
  <dependency>
    <groupId>artifact_group_id</groupId>
    <artifactId>my.lib</artifactId>
    <version>2.2</version>
    <type>library</type>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>C:\path\to\your\library.dll</systemPath>
  </dependency>
  [...]
</dependencies>
+------+

  Supply the proper values for the dependency's <<<\<groupId\>>>>, <<<\<artifactId\>>>>, <<<\<version\>>>>,
  <<<\<type\>>>>, <<<\<scope\>>>>, and <<<\<systemPath\>>>>.
  Exact match of <<<artifactId>>> and <<<version>>> are required when manually adding dependencies into the project's
  <<<pom.xml>>>.

  Note that in general system dependencies are not recommended as they may be located elsewhere on a different machine.
  If they are required, you may mitigate this problem by using a property value that can be set differently on
  another system:

+------+
<dependencies>
  [...]
  <dependency>
    <groupId>artifact_group_id</groupId>
    <artifactId>my.lib</artifactId>
    <version>2.2</version>
    <type>library</type>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${some.property}\library.dll</systemPath>
  </dependency>
  [...]
</dependencies>
[...]
<properties>
  <some.property>C:\path\to\your</some.property>
</properties>
+------+

  The other system can then override it with <<<mvn -Dsome.property=c:\another\path ...>>> or by adding it to Maven's
  <<<settings.xml>>> file.
