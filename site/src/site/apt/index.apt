Welcome to NPanday

  NPanday provides {{{./plugins/}Maven 2.x plugins}} to support building .NET applications at the command
  line or in your IDE.
  It enables you to use Visual Studio with a Maven-compatible development infrastructure.
  
  NPanday is its own framework, the goal of which is to provide a common Maven build environment across .NET compilers
  (C#, VB), vendors (Microsoft, Novell, DotGNU), and platforms (Windows, Linux). This framework leverages Maven for
  the build lifecycle, making it a small compiler-plugin-framework on top of the larger Maven build-framework.
  
  NPanday Maven Integration Features support console, window and web based applications as listed
  below.
